      This request starts or cancels a database replication operation.
      
      You can cancel continuous replications by adding the cancel field to the JSON request object and setting the value to true. Note that the structure of the request must be identical to the original for the cancellation request to be honoured. For example, if you requested continuous replication, the cancellation request must also contain the continuous field.

      This request creates a new document or creates a new revision of an existing document. It enables you to specify the identifier for a new document rather than letting the software create an identifier. If you want to create a new document and let the software create an identifier, use the POST /db request.
      If the document specified by doc does not exist, a new document is created and assigned the identifier specified in doc. If the document already exists, the document is updated with the JSON document in the message body and given a new revision.

    summary: Add or update document
    description: |
      This request adds or updates the supplied request content as an attachment to the specified document. The attachment name must be a URL-encoded string (the file name). You must also supply either the rev query parameter or the If-Match HTTP header for validation, and the Content-Type headers (to set the attachment content type).

        When uploading an attachment using an existing attachment name, the corresponding stored content of the database will be updated. Because you must supply the revision information to add an attachment to the document, this serves as validation to update the existing attachment.

        Uploading an attachment updates the corresponding document revision. Revisions are tracked for the parent document, not individual attachments.
