      Log keys specify functional areas. Enabling logging for a log key provides additional diagnostic information for that area.
      
      Following are descriptions of the log keys that you can specify as a comma-separated list in the Log property. In some cases, a log key has two forms, one with a plus sign (+) suffix and one without, for example CRUD+ and CRUD. The log key with the plus sign logs more verbosely. For example for CRUD+, the log contains all of the messages for CRUD and additional ones for CRUD+.

      - Rejects all access to the database through the Public REST API (503 Service Unavailable).
      - Rejects most Admin API requests (503 Service Unavailable). Sync Gateway processes a small set of Admin API 
      requests.
      - Does not take the backing Couchbase Server bucket offline. The bucket remains available and Sync Gateway 
      keeps its connection to the bucket.

   summary: Purge document
   description: |
     When an application deletes a document a tombstone revision is created, over time the number of tombstones can become significant. Tombstones allow document deletions to be propagated to other clients via replication. For some applications the replication of a tombstone may not be useful after a period of time. The purge command provides a way to remove the tombstones from a Sync Gateway database, recovering storage space and reducing the amount of data replicated to clients.

    summary: Reprocess all documents by the database in the sync function.
    description: |
      This request causes all documents to be reprocessed by the database sync function. The _resync operation should be called if the sync function for a databse has been modified in such a way that the channel or access mappings for any existing document would change as a result.
      
      When the sync function is invoked by _resync, the requireUser() and requireRole() calls will always return 'true'.
      
      A _resync operation on a database that is not in the offline state will be rejected (503 Service Unavailable).
      
      A _resync operation will block until all documents in the database have been processed.
