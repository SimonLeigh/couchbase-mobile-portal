      Taking a database offline:
      
      - Cleanly closes all active _changes feeds for this database.
      - Rejects all access to the database through the Public REST API (503 Service Unavailable).
      - Rejects most Admin API requests (503 Service Unavailable). Sync Gateway processes a small set of Admin API 
      requests.
      - Does not take the backing Couchbase Server bucket offline. The bucket remains available and Sync Gateway 
      keeps its connection to the bucket.

   summary: Purge document
   description: |
     When an applicaiton deletes a document a tombstone revison is created, over time the number tombstones can become significant. Tombstones allow document deletions to be propogated to other clients via replication. For some applications the replication of a tombstone may not be useful after period of time. The purge command provides a way to remove the tombstones from a Sync Gateway database, recovering storage space and reducing the amount of data replicated to clients.

    summary: Reprocess all documents by the database in the sync function.
    description: |
      This request causes all documents to be reprocessed by the database sync function. The _resync operation should be called if the sync function for a databse has been modified in such a way that the channel or access mappings for any existing document would change as a result.
      
      When the sync function is invoked by _resync, the requireUser() and requireRole() calls will always return 'true'.
      
      A _resync operation on a database that is not in the offline state will be rejected (503 Service Unavailable).
      
      A _resync operation will block until all documents in the database have been processed.
