    summary: Get attachment
    description: |
      This request retrieves a file attachment associated with the document. The raw data of the associated attachment is returned (just as if you were accessing a static file). The Content-Type response header is the same content type set when the document attachment was added to the database.

    summary: Add or update document
    description: |
      This request adds or updates the supplied request content as an attachment to the specified document. The attachment name must be a URL-encoded string (the file name). You must also supply either the rev query parameter or the If-Match HTTP header for validation, and the Content-Type headers (to set the attachment content type).

        When uploading an attachment using an existing attachment name, the corresponding stored content of the database will be updated. Because you must supply the revision information to add an attachment to the document, this serves as validation to update the existing attachment.

        Uploading an attachment updates the corresponding document revision. Revisions are tracked for the parent document, not individual attachments.

    summary: Bulk get
    description: |
      This request returns any number of documents, as individual bodies in a MIME multipart response.
      Each enclosed body contains one requested document. The bodies appear in the same order as in the request, but can also be identified by their X-Doc-ID and X-Rev-ID headers.
      A body for a document with no attachments will have content type application/json and contain the document itself.
      A body for a document that has attachments will be written as a nested multipart/related body. Its first part will be the document's JSON, and the subsequent parts will be the attachments (each identified by a Content-Disposition header giving its attachment name.)
    parameters:
      - $ref: '#/parameters/revs'
      - $ref: '#/parameters/attachments'
      - in: body
        name: body
        description: List of documents being requested. Each array element is an object that must contain an id property giving the document ID. It may contain a rev property if a specific revision is desired. It may contain an atts_since property (as in a single-document GET) to limit which attachments are sent.
