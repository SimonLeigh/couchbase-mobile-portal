      This request starts or cancels a database replication operation.
      
      You can cancel continuous replications by adding the cancel field to the JSON request object and setting the value to true. Note that the structure of the request must be identical to the original for the cancellation request to be honoured. For example, if you requested continuous replication, the cancellation request must also contain the continuous field.

    summary: Create or update document
    description: |
      This request creates a new document or creates a new revision of an existing document. It enables you to specify the identifier for a new document rather than letting the software create an identifier. If you want to create a new document and let the software create an identifier, use the POST /db request.
      If the document specified by doc does not exist, a new document is created and assigned the identifier specified in doc. If the document already exists, the document is updated with the JSON document in the message body and given a new revision.
