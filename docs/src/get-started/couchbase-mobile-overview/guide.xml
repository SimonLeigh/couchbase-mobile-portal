            Designing and developing mobile applications is not easy. Data availability is actually a key feature for a rich user experience. No matter how hard it is for a developer, users want the latest content from the app on their device. The reality is multiple users may be updating the same documents at the same time or someone may not have the latest dataset on their device.  Always having the data available to create the best user experience both online and offline is where Couchbase Mobile comes in.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Multiple mobile devices are able to sync their application data across to all users as Couchbase Mobile is able to determine when content changed. As an app developer, you interact with data in a natural way through JSON documents in a local database. When your app needs to monitor for changes, it can. When your app needs to sync with other apps, it can do that too with only a few additional lines of code. This complex process is abstracted away completely by Couchbase Mobile but you still decide how, what and where data is stored.  Let us explore the components below.

            Having a mobile database will allow for your users to interact with your mobile app quickly as the data can now all be persisted on their mobile device. Couchbase enable apps to store and operate on application data in JSON documents without requiring pre-defined schemas or relying always on network connectivity for app content.

                Couchbase in your application is the always available, fast content solution that begins with the implementation of an embedded NoSQL database library within your project. The Couchbase Lite SDK is a full featured JSON database for your iOS, Android, or Xamarin project that enables apps to be always responsive with offline support.

                Data persistance is possible with Couchbase Lite as a stand alone database or along with the cloud sync component described below in Couchbase Sync Gateway section.  Learn how to implement a database in your mobile app by exploring the 'Couchbase Lite Overview.'

                <paragraph><image href="images/sync_gateway_00.png" width="20%" height="20%" style="float: right;"/>  The Sync component allows for storing and retrieving data from the cloud. Sync scales horizontally handling the network load with persistence backed by a Couchbase Server cluster.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Sync Gateway is able to authenticate, manage and sync your application data to the cloud where users are able to gather the latest data.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Sync Gateway not only facilitates the exchange of data but also orchestrates what user relevant data needs to be replicated to mobile apps on the device or be pushed to the cloud. Learn about what Sync Gateway is in more detail in the 'What is Sync Gateway' section.</paragraph>
